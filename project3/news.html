<h3>Back to Work</h3>
<p>In February of 2022 Niall Horan announced that he has been hard at work in the studio. On Twitter he even replied to a fan, revealing his daily routine of spending so much time in the studio. It's likely that we can expect a new album coming shortly. Horan's last album, Heartbreak Weather, released in 2020 and fans have been anxious for a new release.</p>
